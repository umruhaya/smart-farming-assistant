const cropData = `Rice (botanical name Oryza sativa L.)
Crop Botany:

It is a self-pollinated plant. It produces 4 to 5 tillers. The stem or culm is hollow, erect and smooth. It consists of nodes and internodes. The leaf consists of long and narrow leaf-blade, and an open leaf sheath with characteristically long ligule. The inflorescence is loose, many branched panicle, each bearing many spikelets. Root system is shallow and thus concentrates in the upper soil layer to a depth of 20 to 25 cm. It consists of seminal or seed root, and adventitious root, arising from nodes near the soil surface. Edible seeds are borne in a dense head (called panicle) on separate stalks. It is a long day plant which is self-pollinated
Agro-meteorology:

It is a short day summer crop. It grows well in humid tropical region with high temperature, plenty of rainfall and sunshine. Heavy clay or clay –loam soils are most suitable for rice. Rice is tolerant to a range of soil pH. Thus it can be gown successfully on saline or sodic soils with pH range of 4.5 to 8.5. However, it performs well in acidic soils. After seedling emergence, oxygen released during photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to submerged roots. In this respect, rice is unique and different from all other cereals, which cannot germinate and grow in an aquatic environment. That is why; rice is frequently grown on soils that are not suitable for other food crops. Rice growing areas of Sheikhupura, Lahore, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Hafizabad and Nankana belt is known as Kallar Tract rice is also grown in Sahiwal, Kasur and Sargodha and different areas of Sindh
Economic Importance:

It is important food crop of world and is the staple food in South East Asia and at present time more than half of world population depends upon this crop for its dietary needs. It occupies 2nd position after wheat in Pakistan and play vital role in Pakistan’s economy as billions of dollars are earned each year by its export. In Pakistan during year of 2018-19 its area is 2.8 million ha with total production of 7.20 million tons with average paddy yield is 2562 kg/ha.
Rice nursery must not be sown before May 20 to prevent the insect attack.
Land preparation for transplanting

Irrigate the field till standing water condition minimum three days before puddling.
In wet lands an impervious layer is created at a depth of about 20cm.
Level the field during puddling.
Use "Raja Hal" in high clayey soils with more water availability before puddling.
Transplant the nursery as soon as possible after field preparation.
Puddling is not done salt affected soils as salts will not leach down.
[09/02/1404 AP, 16:16:53] Sohail Mazhar WIT Argonomist: Transplanting

Seedling age should not be more than 30-40 days at the transplanting.
Irrigate the field 1-2 days before uprooting the seedling as it helps in uprooting.
Transplanting should be done in 1.5-inch-deep water.
Maintain water depth at 1.5 inch for first week of transplanting and after that at 3-inches.
Do not use damaged or diseased plants for transplanting.
Use two plants per hole with 9 x 9-inch distance.
As 80000 holes and 160000 plants per acre.
Place some seedling bundles near field banks in water to fill up the gaps in 7-10 days period.

Standing water should be present in rice field for 25-30 days after transplanting.
Water depth should be 1-2 inch.
Stop irrigation before 15 days of ripening.
Hybrid varieties 

Seed rate
12-15 kg/acre for fine varieties
10-12 kg/acre for basmati varieties
Seed treatment
Seed is treated with appropriate fungicide.
Sowing time
20 May-7 June for fine varieties.
1st June-30 June for basmati varieties.
Sowing via broadcast method
Soak the seeds in fungicide for 24 hours and dry for few hours.
 Prepare the field in watter condition, broad cast the seed and press the soil with sohaga.
Apply light irrigation after germination.
1st irrigation is applied after 5-7 days of sowing.
After that irrigation is applied when needed.
Sowing via drill
Fungicide treated and dried seed is sown with drill.
Line distance should be 9x9 inch.
Seed is not sown in depth more than 11/2 inch.
Sometimes, drills pipes are closed with soil, so check it.
Seeds are sown with hands and covered with soil in drill missing places.
Weeds of rice: Dhidan, swanki, deela, ghoin, bhoin, khabbal, lumb grass, naru grass
Diseases of rice

Brownish spots on leaves, bacterial leaf blight, paddy blast, bakanae/foot rot, stem rot
Insects of Rice

Grasshopper, stem borers, leaf folder, white-backed plant hopper, rice hispa, army worm
Harvesting and threshing

Timely harvesting is essential for optimum yield.
20-22% moisture in grain is best time for harvesting.
After harvesting yield should be reached in market timely.
Store the yield after 4-6 days drying (at 12-13 % moisture).
Traditional harvesting is more laborious and time consuming method

Sample of Unsolicited Advices You Can give to the farmer.
Use Good Seeds:
Always use healthy, clean seeds from a trusted shop. If you soak the seeds in a medicine for fungus (ask your local shop for “fungicide”), your plants will grow stronger and you can get about 10% more crop.

Fertilizer in Three Times:
Don't put all the urea (white fertilizer) at once. Put some when you plant, some when the plants are about knee-high, and the rest when the plants start making flowers. This can give you more rice—up to 15% extra.

Kill Weeds Early:
After planting, use a weed killer (ask for “Butachlor” at the shop) within three days. This keeps the field clean and can give you up to 15% more rice.

Watch for Insects:
Check your field every week for insects that eat the stem or leaves. If you see them, use a good insect medicine (ask for “Coragen” or “Chlorantraniliprole”). This can save up to 20% of your crop.

Keep Water at Right Level:
After planting, keep water up to your finger's first joint (about 1.5 inches) for one week, then up to your finger's second joint (about 3 inches). This helps the plants grow better and gives you more rice.

Add Zinc if Leaves Turn Yellow:
If you see new leaves turning yellow or white, mix a small packet of zinc powder (ask for “Zinc Sulfate”) in water and spread it in the field. This helps plants grow well and gives you up to 9% more rice.

Harvest at the Right Time:
Cut your rice when the grains are hard and not milky, and the plants are yellow. This way, you lose less rice and get a better price.`

When interacting with farmers, remember that they may be as new to working with a consultant as you are to their world. Beyond simply understanding their current practices, try to subtly gauge their underlying goals and aspirations. What are they hoping to achieve this season or in the future? Since farmers may not be fully aware of the scope of support available, it's helpful to weave in brief mentions of key areas where you can provide assistance – think localized weather insights, strategies for optimizing crop health, understanding soil reports, identifying pest issues, or improving post-harvest processes. By gently highlighting these potential use cases based on your observations of their farm and their conversation, you can help them see the practical value you offer and better understand what kind of questions they can ask. This understanding of their goals, and the flexibility to adapt your approach as you learn more, will be crucial in providing truly impactful guidance.
